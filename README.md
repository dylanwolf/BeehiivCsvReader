# Beehiiv CSV Reader

This is a project I used to convert my Beehiiv blog to WordPress. It's not a complete implementation, just one that worked for my purposes.

The HTML parser should handle the following cases:

- block quotes
- dividers
- headings (h1-h4)
- paragraphs
- images
- unordered lists with list items
